This is a presentation I gave during my departments Share-Anything knowledge sharing cycle. I have been a long-time user of <a href="http://www.ledger-cli.org/" target="_BLANK">Ledger-CLI</a>, and am of the opinion that everyone should be keeping account of their personal finances.

The first part of the presentation introduces the basics of accounting, the second half goes through some of the functionality of Ledger-CLI
specifically. If plain text files and command-line tools are too bare-bones for you, the principles apply to any tool, even pen-and-paper (though
I suggest <a href="http://gnucash.org/" target="_BLANK">GnuCash</a> if you want to have a graphical user interface).
