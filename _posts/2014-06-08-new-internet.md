After almost two months waiting, they finally installed some new fiber-optic switches in our compound and hooked us up. So now we're getting a stable
23Mbps down ... if we're staying on the Chinese intranet. In fact, I just switched over our DNS to OpenDNS, since Google's DNS has been abysmal the
last few months (>50% packet loss, and ping times > 250ms) Most of Google's services are still barely if at all functioning. I've even had to switch
over to using Bing, since the main search page times out.

Let's hope that now we've passed the 25th anniversary they will relax the GFW a bit again.
