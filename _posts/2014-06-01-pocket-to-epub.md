I recently created a utility in Python that will ask you for access to your <a href="http://getpocket.com/" target="_BLANK">Pocket</a> account, fetch
your list of unread articles, fetch each article in this list and convert them to individual ePub files. It is still very much 0.0.1, but if you're
interested, pull the github repo and give it a try!
