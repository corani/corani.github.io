I was watching Louis Theroux's LA Stories part 2 - Edge of Life - tonight. After it was finished I just sat there staring at the screen for a long
time, with a new respect for Theroux.

Such an incredibly difficult topic to discuss, people at the edge of life, with medically no chance of recovery. Two of the portrait people died
during the episode, and just one guy made a miracle recovery after being in a vegetative state for over a month. A less than one-in-a-million chance.

I found Theroux's report very honest and moving... Not quite sure what I would want if it were me... Being kept alive with remaining a vegetable as
the best-case scenario? Taking another round of chemo therapy after the previous four rounds failed miserably?

I don't think I would want that... but then again, they say there are no atheists on the battlefield.
