description: "Across all cultures that have been studied, light colors are consistently associated with goodness and weakness, while dark colors are consistently perceived as strong but evil. On psychological inventories, test subjects rate lighter colors as more pleasant and less dominant. Dark colors on the other hand elicit emotions of anger, hostility, dominance, and aggression."

**Part one:**
Man is stopped on some trumped up charges, asks many times if he's being detained, but the officer refuses to answer.
Man refuses to show his ausweiss until he's given a valid reason, eventually let go with a verbal warning. (<a href="" target="_BLANK">Youku</a>)

I hope they're real proud of themselves, with their black uniforms...

**Part two:**
But wait, it get's better! Only a few minutes later, apparently the officer called up some friends:

Man is stopped *again*, this time because he wouldn't show his ausweiss the first time. Continues to ask if he's being
detained, this officer refuses to answer as well. So the man still won't show his ausweiss. Dragged out of the car by
a handful of American "heroes" and arrested for hindering an investigation. ï»¿(<a href="" target="_BLANK">Youku</a>)
