**Part one:**
Man is stopped by an officer who *thought* he wasn't wearing a seatbelt (he was). Man asks many times if he's being detained,
but the officer refuses to answer. Man refuses to show his ausweiss until he's given a valid reason, eventually let go with a
verbal warning. (<a href="//v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNzg1MzAyNjQ0.html" target="_BLANK">Youku</a>)

**Part two:**
But wait, it get's better! Only a few minutes later, apparently the officer called up some buddies:

Man is stopped *again*, this time because he wouldn't show his ausweiss the first time. Continues to ask if he's being
detained, this officer refuses to answer as well. So the man still won't show his ausweiss. Dragged out of the car by
a handful of American "heroes" and arrested for hindering an investigation. ï»¿(<a href="" target="_BLANK">Youku</a>)

I hope they're real proud of themselves, with their black uniforms...

When the passenger, who fully cooperated from the start, is released, he politely asks for a lift home. The answer of
those supposed to protect and *serve*? **Walk**

**The problem:**
There are absolutely no consequences for the officers involved. This case could very well lead to a lawsuit, but even
then, the damages will be paid by the public, while the officers go their merry way. They need to be held *personally*
responsible.

In every civilized country, upon realizing the man *was* indeed wearing his seatbelt during the first stop, the officer
would have congratulated him on his responsible behaviour and sent him on his way.

You don't need an ID. You don't need intimidation of an innocent man. And you *certainly* don't need to call up your
buddies and have the man stopped *again* and arrested on some bogus charges, just because he stood in his right and
didn't shut up like the slave you consider him to be.

**Whatever happened to the police-blue?**

In other words, it's all about intimidation. And apparently wearing black not only *looks* more intimidating, it also
makes the person wearing it actually *become* more aggressive. Now where in history did we see this pattern before...?
