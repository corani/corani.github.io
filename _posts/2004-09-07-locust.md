This morning I was rudely awakend from my sleep by my roommate. While she was going to the bathroom, she stumbled upon this beautiful creature.

So I was appointed to `get the scary animal out of the bathroom'. Knowing fried and sugared locust is a treat to many people, I suggested we'd give it a try, but that idea didn't really appeal (^_^) So with some care I transported the locust outside, onto the balcony, where it's still sitting around ever since I released it a few hours ago. 

If anyone is interested in some nice fried locust, here's a recipe: 

*Ingredients:*

- 3/4 cup sifted flour 
- 1 teaspoon baking powder 
- 1 teaspoon salt 
- 3/4 cup milk 
- 1 egg slightly beaten 
- 1 cup grasshoppers 
- 1 pint heavy cream beaten stiff 

Sift flour, baking powder and salt together into a bowl. Slowly add milk and beat until smooth. Add egg and beat well. Pluck off grasshopper wings and legs, heads optional. Dip insects in egg batter and deep fry. Salt and serve. 

Too bad there's only one! Otherwise this could make a nice snack (^_~) 

*UPDATE @12:10*
If you're interested in eating fried locust, don't bother coming over, since our infamous locust seems to have taken off. It's no longer to be found at our balcony...
