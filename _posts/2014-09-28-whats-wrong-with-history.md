I just realized what's wrong with history education (at least at the below university level): they're starting at the wrong end. Not only is what happened ten thousand years ago pretty
much irrelevant for us today, we have almost no facts and rely mostly on speculation. 

We should teach history by starting yesterday and working our way backwards. It's already hard enough to get the facts about yesterday, and it's only going downhill from there. This is
one of the most important things students should learn. 

And why always political history? Why not something students care about? Cars? Computers? Fashion? Any subject can be studied to learn the technique of history, instead of a random
assortment of "facts" that are currently in vogue.﻿

The problem is that history lessons currently are used not for teaching the technique of history, but as a means for some agenda. "History is written by the victors", they teach the kids
one version of history, and usually one that shows some kind of positive narrative to support their current status quo, or even by cherry-picking some events to bolster patriotism or
nationalism. 

That is not history, that's brainwashing.﻿
