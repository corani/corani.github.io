I found out about the "<a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/" target="_BLANK">FizzBuzz</a>" test for programmers
today. It is a test that some companies use to make sure the people they're hiring for programming positions can actually program. Apparently
a vast number of applicants can't even pass this simple test! The question is as follows:

<blockquote>
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of
five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
</blockquote>

Since I've been brushing up on my C++ skills by taking a couple of classes on modern C++11, I decided to have a try and came up with the smart-ass
answer below:

{% highlight c++ %}
#include <iostream>

int main(void) {
    for (int i = 1; i < 101; i++)
        std::cout << i
                  << (i % 3 ? "" : "\b\b\bFizz   ")
                  << (i % 5 ? "" : "\b\b\bBuzz")
                  << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Since I write more Scheme code than C++, I had another go at it using Scheme, with the even more smart-ass solution below. It looks complicated
because I solved it the hard way, by creating a generator that will give you the next FizzBuzz ad infinit. Then I map it over a range of numbers
to just get the first 100.

For some reason, in my <a href="http://racket-lang.org/" target="_BLANK">DrRacket</a> there was no range operation, so I had to write that one as
well. (Using a range with a generator kind of defeats the purpose, but this was just an exercise)

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (fizzbuzz)
  (define call/cc call-with-current-continuation)
  (define (stream-fizzbuzz return)
    (let loop ((n 1))
      (set! return (call/cc (lambda (continue-here)
         (set! stream-fizzbuzz continue-here)
         (return (or (and (= (remainder n 15) 0) 'fizzbuzz)
                     (and (= (remainder n  3) 0) 'fizz)
                     (and (= (remainder n  5) 0) 'buzz)
                     n))
      )))
      (loop (+ n 1))
    ) 
  )
  (define (generator) (call/cc stream-fizzbuzz))

  (define (range start end)
    (if (> start end)
      '()
      (cons start (range (+ start 1) end)))
  )

  (map (lambda (x) (generator)) (range 1 100))
)
{% endhighlight %}
